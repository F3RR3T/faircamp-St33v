[Verse 1]  
Each careful note let Bach anoint,  
A world tuned tight with sacred laws.  
Voices spun in counterpoint,  
Where every note obeys a cause.  
The harpsichord sang in silver tones,  
A lattice built from holy bones.  
  
[Verse 2]  
Prodigy afire in powdered curls,  
Wolfie plays with laughter in a gilded hall.  
Grace in balance, dance and twirl,  
Let logic dance and never fall.  
The forte-piano, light and clear,  
A softer voice, yet drawing near.  
  
[Chorus]  
Ludwig Van stood with arms held high,  
But could not hear the sky reply.  
Vienna roared, but he heard none...  
The birth of joy, the death of one.  
On May the Seventh, Eighteen-Twenty-Four,  
He cracked the gate, and changed the score.  
Too much, too soon; too fierce to frame.  
  
[Verse 3  
Beethoven's storms tore new forms of tone.  
A titan unchained the bonds of fate.  
Thunder in the rhythm’s bones,  
He built a world too vast to sate.  
The piano groaned and shook the floor,  
Hammers breaking heaven’s door.  
  
[Verse 4]  
Iron frame strong strings of steel,  
Twelve Tone Equal Temperament.  
From velvet rooms to foundry bells,  
The piano's strength became immense.  
The sacred softened into steam,  
A scream beneath the engine's dream.  
  
[Bridge]  
What breaks when progress breaks the form?  
What stirs in silence after storm?  
Each age rejects what came before;  
Then steals its bones and calls it lore.  
Bach  
Mozart  
Beethoven  
Ghosts: each stranger in their time.  
  
O Freunde, nicht diese Töne!  
Sondern laßt uns angenehmere anstimmen,  
und freudenvollere.  
Freude!  
Freude!  
Freude, schöner Götterfunken  
Tochter aus Elysium,  
Wir betreten feuertrunken,  
Himmlische, dein Heiligtum!  
Deine Zauber binden wieder  
Was die Mode streng geteilt;  
Alle Menschen werden Brüder,  
Wo dein sanfter Flügel weilt!
