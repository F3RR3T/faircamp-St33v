[Intro]  
(Ready Player One!)  
(Hop, hop, jump!)  
cross the street—    
skip the beat—    
glitch the heat—    
no retreat—  
  
[Verse]  
(Lane One)  
Power line pulse,    
plastic rhythm in a burst,    
Every step is random truth,    
Ribbit! Dive into the verse.  
  
[Bridge]  
(Lane Two)  
Floating...    
Am I code or creature?    
The sky flickers.    
I'm still mid-jump.  
  
[Chorus]  
(FROGGER!)  
I jump the genre lane—    
collide, survive, remain!    
Noise is not in vain—    
I jump the genre lane!  
  
[Verse]  
(Lane Three)  
NOISE!    
BUFFER!    
SPLIT!    
RENDER ME—  
  
(Glitch scream)  
Hop again—left, right,    
don't let the MIDI bite.  
  
[Chorus]  
(FROGGER!)  
I jump the genre lane—    
collide, survive, remain!    
Noise is not in vain—    
I jump the genre lane!  
  
[Outro - solo pipe organ + accordion]  
I made it across    
(to what?)    
Only the silence knows.  
  
(Game over !)  
[explosion]
