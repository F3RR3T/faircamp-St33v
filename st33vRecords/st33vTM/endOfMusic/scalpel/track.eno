[Intro]  
Not a hammer... not a bomb...  
A whisper in the circuit.  
Draw a line so fine it bleeds thought.  
  
[Verse 1]  
Every tool reflects intention.  
Every cut reveals a choice.  
You can automate the noise—  
Or sculpt a single, silent voice.  
In the data, echoes tremble.  
In the loop, your self returns.  
You reach for patterns,  
But the scalpel burns.  
  
[Chorus]  
AI is a force multiplier.  
Use it like a scalpel.  
Not to carve a canyon,  
But to stitch a suture.  
  
Amplify the subtle.  
Don’t detonate the future.  
This is not the time  
for blunt force dreaming.  
  
[Verse 2]  
Write with precision.  
Compose with doubt.  
Let the model speak  
But you decide what not to shout.  
Build machines with mirrors,  
Not with masks.  
Let the questions deepen:  
Don’t rush the task.  
  
[Bridge]  
Scalpel… not sword.  
Syntax over spectacle.  
Quiet over quantity.  
One true cut.  
One less harm.  
  
[Chorus - Refrain]  
AI is a force multiplier.  
Use it like a scalpel.  
To widen thought—  
Not just reach.  
  
[Outro]  
So sharpen your signal.  
We are what we amplify.  
Whisper wisely,  
While the machine listens.
