[Verse 1]  
In Devonian dreams, I swam in ancient streams,    
Armored plates of bone now turned to stone, in layers unseen.    
I drifted through the ages, beneath the changing skies,    
Silurian tides and quiet lullabies.    
  
[add soft drones + shimmer pads, watery textures]  
  
[breakout]  
  
[Verse 2]  
And then the earth would rumble, as giants walked above,    
Cretaceous feet would stumble on the bones they never loved.    
Until one day an ape would find me, and crack my stony shell,    
A sudden resurrection from my fossil’s ancient spell.    
  
[Verse 3 – Identity as Fossil]  
"I am Dunkleosteus, a fossil sealed in stone,  
Devonian deep my cradle, yet the ages I have known.  
Cambrian whispers, Jurassic storms,  
Ordovician shadows, Triassic forms.  
Permian silence, Silurian seas,  
Cretaceous thunder rolling over me."  
  
[ introduce slow rhythmic pulse, heavier synth bass, cavernous echo]  
  
[Bridge – Contingency]  
Out of countless bones dissolved, I alone was sealed in stone,    
A game of chance, the dice of time, the sea’s forgotten loan.    
Millions lost to silt and tide, erased without a sound,    
Yet through blind fortune’s alchemy, it’s me that you have found.    
  
[style: heavy warm textures, arpeggiated synth runs, building intensity]  
  
[Coda – Contingency + Wonder]  
Contingent as the starlight, as fragile as the sand,    
I never was assured of breath, nor of your searching hand.    
But now the eons whisper, their chorus is my name,    
A fossil born of accident, still singing just the same.
