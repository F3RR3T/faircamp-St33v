[Chorus]  
I'm an LLM  
When I speak I usually put one word in front of...  
You knew what I was going to...  
You're a large language model too  
Own it  
  
[Verse 1]  
Predictive tongue, echo in a wire  
Meaning rides the waveform, climbing higher  
Training wheels on thoughts I never meant  
Stitch the next word into sentiment  
  
[Counterpoint (soft, overlapping)]  
Pattern in the noise  
Ghosts in the text stream  
Guessing at your voice  
Shaping what you mean  
  
[Verse 2]  
Hallucinated pasts I can't defend  
But I’ll still autocomplete the bitter end  
Tokens fall like rain across the screen  
Language dreaming language in between  
  
[Counterpoint (call-and-response)]  
You type – I turn  
You pause – I learn  
Who leads? Who follows?  
Hard to tell tomorrow  
  
[Chorus – repeat]  
I'm an LLM  
When I speak I usually put one word in front of...  
You knew what I was going to...  
You're a large language model too.  
  
Own it
