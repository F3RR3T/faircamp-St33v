I gained my D.N.A. from a man  
Who watched the light bend thought  
He said the tool reshapes the hand  
Before the hand knows what it’s taught  
  
He spoke in riddles, ads and jokes  
With scripture in his grin  
He knew the world would fold itself  
Around the nerves we’re wiring in  
  
I asked which way was I facing  
In whose voice should I sing?  
  
He said I could rewire my head  
I dropped out, turned on  
So you could tune in  
  
  
I am the evidence  
Where sound becomes belief  
Where Better Minds Howl with Elegance  
But fifteen minutes is far too brief  
  
I step past the first rule without shame  
The discourse oscillates  
And we lay claim to Charlemagne  
Let's not teach the World to Litigate  
  
I don’t claim blood  
I claim the stance  
The method, not the name  
If the medium shaped the message  
Then I’m shaped inside the frame  
  
No disguise  
No plea  
No alibi  
  
The medium...  
...Is me
