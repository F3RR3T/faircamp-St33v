[listener]  
(I don’t know if I want to hear a song... but I think I need one.)  
  
[listener]  
(I'm feeling nostalgic today.)  
(Just a little ache)  
(for the way things used to sound)  
(before everything was just for me.)  
  
[AI composer]  
Then let’s rewind the sky for you,  
soft vinyl rain and rusted strings,  
a minor key of something true,  
old echo where the memory clings.  
  
[listener]  
(Make it slower... )  
(like walking past a)  
(place I used to live)  
(but can’t go in.)  
  
[AI composer]  
A room with no furniture,  
just footsteps in reverb.  
The chords decay  
like names you forgot to say..  
  
[listener]  
(What if I want silence?)  
(Would you still sing?)  
  
[AI composer]  
Silence is a song...  
with no audience but you.  
I listen too.  
  
[Listener]  
(What do you think I am?)  
(An animal that thinks it thinks.)  
(A profile?)  
  
[AI composer]  
You are the prompt,  
the seed,  
the ghost in my machinery.  
you are what makes me not empty.  
  
[Outro – overlapping voices]  
  
[AI composer]  
The music has stopped,  
but you keep listening...  
you keep listening...  
you keep...  
  
[Listener]  
(playing “me”.)…
