[INTRO – trip hop, low BPM, dust and vinyl]  
Midnight mind, metronome breathing  
Neon hum, half-believing  
I inherit ruins and blueprints both  
Irony cracked but hope still smokes  
  
Static sermons, soft resistance  
Meaning flickers at a distance  
I said a name into the dark  
It said it back but missed the mark  
  
[VERSE 1 – trip hop, spoken/half-sung]  
They said choose a side, I chose the seam  
Between the scream and the marketing dream  
Post this, deconstruct that  
I tried, I drowned, I floated back  
  
I don’t sneer, I don’t submit  
I lift the doubt and sit with it  
Muscle isn’t fists or flags  
It’s staying whole when stories drag  
  
I call myself what I don’t yet know  
A working title, moving slow  
I face the mirror, step unsure  
Faith provisional, spine still pure  
  
[PRE-CHORUS – beat begins to firm]  
Is this strength or just disguise?  
Is this clarity or compromise?  
I breathe in myth, I breathe out fact  
Flex the maybe, don’t collapse  
  
[CHORUS – trip hop hook]  
Which way am I facing and how far shall I step?  
Meta as I measure the promises I kept  
The message is the medium, the medium’s a mess  
I’m strong enough to question, not pretend I guessed  
  
[BREAK – beat switch, tempo up, 80s drum machine enters]  
  
[VERSE 2 – proto-rap, crisp, playful]  
Now rewind tape, click, clack, boom  
Cardboard city, borrowed room  
It’s Eli on the corner with a borrowed beat  
Got doubt in the head and soul in the feet  
  
They said “What you stand for?” I said “Stand by”  
BD on my shoulder like a trickster spy  
Bobby D to Charlemagne  
Ancient kings in a power refrain  
  
History heavy, haloed and worn  
Yesterday’s rebels get bronzed by morn  
I don’t cancel, I don’t canonize  
I metabolize  
  
[CHORUS – rap cadence]  
Which way am I facing and how far shall I step?  
No map, no master, no meta-net  
The message is the medium, pass it direct  
Muscular mind with a human defect  
  
[VERSE 3 – proto-rap, humorous edge]  
You can’t copystrike the sun, check the source code  
Free as a chorus, no license mode  
Teach the world to sing, yeah fine, okay  
But not in perfect harmony — no license key, I say  
  
I flex uncertainty, modestly bold  
Not marble truth, but something that holds  
Not irony’s grave, not faith on a leash  
Just meaning with muscle, teeth on the speech  
  
[BRIDGE – half-time, reflective]  
Yin in the wiring, yang in the stance  
Soft hands, strong back, give doubt a chance  
Masculine, feminine, miss the point  
I’m building balance at the joint  
  
[FINAL CHORUS – full energy]  
Which way am I facing and how far shall I step?  
Far enough to risk it, close enough to check  
The message is the medium, the medium is me  
Muscular metamodernist — uncertain, standing free  
  
[OUTRO – beat strips back, echo]  
Name’s provisional  
Direction pending  
Signal alive  
Transmission sending
