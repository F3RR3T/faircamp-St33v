[VERSE 1]  
I got on at Blood on the Tracks  
Midwinter, mid-thirties, suitcase cracked  
Tangled Up in Blue seats, torn upholstery  
Every love’s a wound if you tell it closely  
  
He’s beside me, hat pulled low  
Says names don’t matter, then says his does  
Talks in riddles, coughs up smoke  
Says truth is just a different joke  
  
[PRE-CHORUS]  
I ask him straight, he laughs and stalls  
Says “I contain multitudes” then denies it all  
  
[CHORUS]  
First rule of Bob D  
You don’t explain Bobby D  
Second rule, you change the tune  
Right when they start to listen  
I’m riding shotgun with a ghost and a grin  
Trying to work out where belief begins  
Slow train coming, fast blood drying  
Am I watching history  
Or am I next in line?  
  
[VERSE 2]  
He says Desire’s just a mask  
Scarlet bandana, rolling cast  
Hurricane stories, violin crime  
Truth bends better when it rhymes  
  
Street-Legal sermons, horns too loud  
Choir creeping in from the crowd  
I say “Is this where faith kicks in?”  
He says “Kid, faith is a different skin”  
  
[PRE-CHORUS]  
He points ahead, track starts to glow  
Says “You don’t find God — He boards you slow”  
  
[CHORUS]  
First rule of B. D.  
Never trust the phase  
Third rule, burn the map  
Fourth rule, praise and blame  
Blood on the tracks, then a ticket stub  
From heartbreak hotel to the Book of Job  
Slow Train Coming, no return fare  
I don’t know if I’m following  
Or already there  
  
[BRIDGE – UNRELIABLE NARRATOR]  
Maybe he’s real  
Maybe he’s me  
Maybe I read him into history  
Charlemagne with a harmonica crown  
Founding empires, burning them down  
  
He says “Saved isn’t irony”  
I say “Neither is Shot of Love”  
He says “You want sincerity?”  
I say “Yeah — but not enough”  
  
[BREAK]  
The train won’t stop  
The questions stack  
Every answer changes the track  
  
[VERSE 3]  
He quotes scripture, then quotes himself  
Leaves both unlabeled on the shelf  
I say “Did you mean it?”  
He says “At the time”  
Which feels like truth  
Or feels like a crime  
  
I check my reflection in the window glass  
See Eli Mercer wearing someone else’s past  
If he could pivot, vanish, return  
What’s the lesson I’m meant to learn?  
  
[FINAL CHORUS]  
First rule of influence  
You swear you’re not influenced  
Second rule, deny the debt  
While you’re counting interest  
Blood on the tracks, slow train hum  
Faith or fracture, here it comes  
He tips his hat, says “You’ll be fine”  
Leaves me alone  
With a voice that sounds like mine  
  
[OUTRO]  
Train keeps rolling  
Names decay  
History’s just a long delay  
If Dylan’s Charlemagne, what am I then?  
Another passenger  
Learning when
